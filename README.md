# GEN_AI_Surgery
Surgical scene segmentation is the process of identifying and delineating different anatomical structures, surgical tools, organs, or regions of interest within 
surgical videos or images. It is a key task in computer-assisted surgery and surgical data science, enabling applications such as real-time surgical 
assistance,autonomous robotic surgery,surgical training & simulation and post-operative analysis.This project aims to implement GenAI based multimodel for surgical 
instrument segmentation,surgical action recognition and surgical scene understanding with vision transformer on videos obtained during surgical procedures.
